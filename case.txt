In the script, the scan_target() function takes a target server as a parameter and performs the following actions:

Port Scanning: It uses the -p1-65535 -sS arguments to perform a TCP SYN scan on all ports.
OS Detection: It uses the -O argument to perform OS detection on the target.
Vulnerability Testing: It uses the -sV --script vulners arguments to perform vulnerability testing using the Vulners script.
You can modify the script according to your needs, such as specifying different scanning options or adding additional functionality.

Remember to use this script responsibly and only scan servers that you have proper authorization to test.
